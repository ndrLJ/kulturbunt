Kulturbunt Website

Description: A website inspired by my favorite Facebook page. Everything learned by working on the Hotel Terassa project was carried over into this project.

I decided to attempt a minimal design combining yellow and black, the colors used by the Facebook page in their logo, which is also present here in the 
left part of the header.

There are 3 different variations of the website design: 1 for small devices, 1 for medium and 1 for large. This evolving, fluid design was inspired by 
comic books, as the owner of the Facebook page is a comic book artist. There is also a collage made out of posts from the page, selected by me, 
as the page itself posts mostly collages.

The animations are minimal. There is no JavaScript.

In order to build this design, I had to learn about working with SVGs. I also had to learn more about CSS Grid in order to make the collage, 
which was a challenging but fun experience. It also deepened my knowledge about mobile-first design and responsiveness.
